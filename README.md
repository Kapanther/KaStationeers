# KaStationeers
A collection of IC10 scripts for the game Stationeers

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized by both general scripts and planet-specific scripts:

### GENERAL
Contains IC10 scripts that work universally across all planets and environments. Use these for common automation tasks that don't require planet-specific considerations.

### MARS
Contains IC10 scripts specifically designed for Mars environments. Mars has:
- Thin atmosphere (95.9% CO2)
- Cold temperatures
- Lower atmospheric pressure
- Scripts here may handle Mars-specific atmospheric processing or temperature management

### EUROPA
Contains IC10 scripts specifically designed for Europa (Moon) environments. Europa has:
- Icy surface conditions
- Extremely cold temperatures
- Radiation concerns
- Scripts here may handle extreme cold management and radiation protection

### VENUS
Contains IC10 scripts specifically designed for Venus environments. Venus has:
- Extremely hot temperatures
- High atmospheric pressure
- Corrosive atmosphere
- Scripts here may handle high-temperature operations and pressure management

## Getting Started

Each folder contains a `hello_world.ic10` sample script to help you get started with IC10 programming. Simply load these scripts into an IC housing in Stationeers to see them in action.

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own IC10 scripts to the appropriate folders. Make sure to:
- Add comments explaining what your script does
- Place planet-specific scripts in the appropriate planetary folder
- Place universal scripts in the GENERAL folder
